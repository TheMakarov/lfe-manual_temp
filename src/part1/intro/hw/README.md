# 'Hello, World!'

Hello-World style introductory programs are intended to give the potential programmer for that language a sense of what it is like to write a minimalist piece of software with the language in question. In particular, it should show off the minimum capabilitiues of the language, essentially, what you could be in for should you decide upon this path.

In the case of LFE/OTP, this is extremely misleading. But more on that in the OTP version of the Hello-World program.

In this section we will concede to conventional practice and produce a minimal Hello-World that does what many other languages' Hello-World programs do.
