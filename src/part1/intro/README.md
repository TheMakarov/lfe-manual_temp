# Introduction

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of computer science known as "distributed systems programming" lies a small red _e_. Orbitting this at a distance roughly proportional to the inverse of the likelihood of it being noticed is an utterly insignificant little green mug filled with the morning beverage stimulant equivalent of That Old Janx Spirit. Upon that liquid floats a little yellow _ùõå_ whose adherents are so amazingly primitive that they still think `cons`s, `car`, and `cdr` are pretty neat ideas.

This is their book.

Their language, Lisp Flavoured Erlang (henceforth "LFE"), lets you use the archaic and much-beloved S-expressions to write some of the most advanced software on the planet. LFE is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional Lisp whose underlying virtual machine (Erlang) was designed to create distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-realtime, highly-availale, always-up, hot-swappable appliances, applications, and services. In addition to fashionable digital watches, LFE sports immutable data, pattern-matching, eager evaluation, and dynamic typing.

This manual will not only teach you what all of that means and why you want it in your breakfast cereal, but also: how to create LFE programs; what exactly are the basic elements of the language; the ins-and-outs of extremely efficient and beautiful clients and servers; and much, much more.

This book is divided into 6 parts with the following foci:

* Introductory material
* Core data types and capabilities
* The basics of LFE code and projects
* Advanced language features
* The machine that is OTP
* Concluding thoughts and summaries

We have written the introduction to provide some code examples, but with very little instruction or explanation. Those will certainly be presented later, but initially we feel it is important to provide a starting place for those who learn best via examples. For those who don't and would rather jump straight into the manual, please have a guilt-free experience and enjoy the next chapter immediately.

There is a lot of material in this book, so just take it section by section. If at any time you feel overwhelmed, simply set down the book, take a deep breath, fix yourself a cuppa, and don't panic.

Welcome to the LFE MACHINE MANUAL, the definitive LFE reference.
