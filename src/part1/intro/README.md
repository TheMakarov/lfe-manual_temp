# Introduction

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of computer science known as "distributed systems programming" lies a small red _e_. Orbitting this at a distance roughly proportional to the inverse of the likelihood of it being noticed is an utterly insignificant little green mug filled with the morning beverage stimulant equivalent of That Old Janx Spirit. Upon that liquid floats a little yellow _ùõå_ whose adherents are so amazingly primitive that they still think `cons`s, `car`, and `cdr` are pretty neat ideas.

This is their book.

Their language, Lisp Flavoured Erlang (henceforth "LFE"), lets you use the archaic and much-beloved S-expressions to write some of the most advanced software on the planet. LFE is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional Lisp whose underlying virtual machine (Erlang) was designed to create distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-realtime, highly-availale, always-up, hot-swappable appliances, applications, and services. In addition to fashionable digital watches, LFE sports immutable data, pattern-matching, eager evaluation, and dynamic typing.

This manual will not only teach you what all of that means and why you want it in your breakfast cereal, but also: how to create LFE programs; what exactly are the basic elements of the language; the ins-and-outs of extremely efficient and beautiful clients and servers; and much, much more.

There is a lot of material here, so just take it section by section. If at any time you feel overwhelmed, simply set down the book, take a deep breath, fix yourself a cuppa, and don't panic.

Welcome to the LFE MACHINE MANUAL, the definitive LFE reference.
