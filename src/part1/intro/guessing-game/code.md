# Code Explore

Now that we've thought through our problem space clearly and cleanly, let's do some code exploration and start defining some functions we think we'll need.

We've already generated an OTP application using the LFE `rebar3` plugin, and once we've got our collection of functions that address the needed game features, we can plug those into the application.

We'll make those changes in the code editor you've opened, and we'll explore a small set of possible functions to use for this using the project REPL session you've just started.
