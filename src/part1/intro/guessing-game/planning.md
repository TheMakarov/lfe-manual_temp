# Planning the Game

We've created our new project, but before we write even a single atom of code, let's take a moment to think about the problem and come up with a nice solution. Byt doing this, we increase our chances of making something both useful and elegant. As long as what we write remains legible and meets our needs, the less we write the better. This sort of practice elegance will make the code easier to maintain and reduce the chance for bugs (by the simple merrit of there being less code in which a bug may arise; the more code, the greater opportunities for bugs).

Our first step will be making sure we understand the problem and devising some minimal abstractions. Next, we'll think about what actually need to happen in the game. With that in hand, we will know what state we need to track. Then, we're off to the races: all the code will fall right into place and we'll get to play our game.
