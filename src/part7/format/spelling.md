# Spelling and Abbreviations

Use correct spelling in your comments, and most importantly in your identifiers. The LFE documentation projects (books and reference materials) use `aspell` and include `make` targets for running various spell-checking tasks across the project files. Feel free to borrow from these for your own projects.

Use common and domain-specific abbreviations, and must be consistent with these abbreviations. You may abbreviate lexical variables of limited scope in order to avoid overly-long symbol names.

If you're not sure, consult a dictionary, look up alternative spellings in a dictionary, or ask a local expert.

Here are examples of choosing the correct spelling:

* Use "complimentary" in the sense of a meal or beverage that is not paid for by the recipient, not "complementary".
* Use "existent" and "nonexistent", not "existant". Use "existence", not "existance".
* Use "hierarchy" not "heirarchy".
* Use "precede" not "preceed".
* Use "weird", not "wierd".

Make appropriate exceptions for industry standard nomenclature/jargon, including plain misspellings. For instance:

* Use "referer", not "referrer", in the context of the HTTP protocol.
