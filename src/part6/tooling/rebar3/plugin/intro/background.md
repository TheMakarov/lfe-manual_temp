# Background

This plugin originally started life as a shell script (`lfetool` -- there's
even a T-shirt for it!), then it toyed with integrating with `rebar` (the
original). Around that time, though, `rebar3` was under initial development,
and LFE took a chance on it as an early adopter. This lead to a whole series of
LFE plugins, but after a few years momentum was lost. 

Those early `rebar3` efforts have been combined into a single plugin in this
project, with many updates and using all the latest approaches developed in
`rebar3`'s now mature ecosystem.
