# Where Next?

We've mentioned the following resources so far:

* [The LFE Tutorial](http://lfe.io/tutorial/)
* [The LFE rebar3 Plugin Command Reference](https://lfe-rebar3.github.io/)
* [The LFE Blog](http://blog.lfe.io/)

But there are also these:

* The old-skool [LFE User Guide](https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/blob/develop/doc/src/lfe_guide.7.md)
* [Example code](https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/tree/develop/examples) in the LFE repository
* The [lfex org](https://github.com/lfex) - Community-contributed libraries
* The [lfe org](https://github.com/lfe) - Core code, tools, and on-line resources (docs, blog, etc.)

True mastery of LFE is not matter of syntax, though: it requires a deep
knowledge of Erlang/OTP and how to best apply that knowledge. The
[Erlang site](http://erlang.org/) has links to great Erlang books you can read.
